# Comments
Comments are based on Python.

The `#` character creates a comment. The comment will last until the end of the line:
```laxe
# This is a comment
def main:
    # it doesn't affect code
    pass
```

## Multiline Comments
Unlike Python, Laxe as a specific syntax for multiline comments. They are started and ended with `###`:
```laxe
###
This is a multiline comment
It will keep going until it meets another:
###
def main:
    pass
```
