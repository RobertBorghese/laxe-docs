# Basic Syntax

While Laxe does provide additional features from Haxe, this section covers Laxe's basic syntax for using Haxe's feature-set. Laxe aims to retain all of the features Haxe provides, such as the ["everything is an expression"](https://code.haxe.org/category/principles/everything-is-an-expression.html) principle. 

While not every aspect of Laxe's syntax may be covered, anything not specified here can be assumed to be identical to Haxe's syntax.
